It represents our physical appearance, our physical bodies and overall health, and the body ego. It can be the mask or costume we wear to greet the world. It reveals our natural and personal defense mechanisms that we use to adapt to - and cope with - our environment. The Ascendant also shows our first impressions of the world around us and our expectations of same \u2013whether we are naturally hesitant or enthusiastic, for example. How we begin new projects and our attitude towards new experiences come under the rule of the Ascendant.<\/p>\n<p>Everybody seems to like people with your Libra rising sign! You just come across as exceptionally\u00a0nice, pleasant, and fair. While the condition of Venus in your chart can modify this, many of you give an easy, warm, and approachable first impression. Look a little closer at the lives of people with your Ascendant, and these nice people may have had quite a few problems in their relationships. Some of them have had a string of relationships, and it can be hard to imagine why! Perhaps it's because people with Libra Ascendants attract others to them effortlessly. Besides, they often don't know what to do with themselves without a significant other. Of course, not all Libra rising people are made the same, and some simply come across as companionable but are quite fine on their own.<\/p>\n<p>You might often be found smoothing everything over - you do love pleasant surroundings! You likely have a particularly charming smile, a gentle approach with others, and an easygoing image. Even those Libra Ascendant natives who are not endowed with classic good looks are attractive. You may very well pay a lot of attention to your personal appearance -- the colors you wear, your hair, the way you walk. The sign of Libra aims for balance, and this can translate as special attention to balance in both your appearance and manner.<\/p>\n<p>You can be enormously persuasive, although you will almost always use a \"soft sell\" approach when you want to win others over, which is all (or most) of the time! A tendency to pass the buck and keep up that \"nice guy\/gal\" image can be your worst qualities. However, you can make an excellent mediator and will generally be the first to accommodate\u00a0others. Peace-making and diplomacy are powerful and necessary skills, and you have them down pat.<\/p>\n<p>Because Aries, Libra's opposing sign, is on your partnership sector or Descendant, you might often find yourself attracted to competent, active partners. This can work out very well for you as your partner can take on the role that you don't want for yourself. If it does cause problems, then there are some things to consider, however. For one, this can sometimes mean that your close relationships have bickering or competitiveness as themes. The more you learn to accept the blame rather than attempt to push it onto others, this can certainly decrease.\u00a0You have a sweet image, yes, but if you overidentify with this image (which is very easy to do!), then this can cause some interpersonal problems. In other instances, however, you attract aggressive people into your life because you seem so malleable, and this can be toxic - you'll need to draw some boundaries. Most of the time, however, seeking out a more assertive partner works just fine for you, and much will have to do with how Mars, ruler of Aries, is doing in your chart.<\/p>\n<p>You are wonderfully gracious and accommodating, making you a real asset to any group. You are remarkedly skilled at negotiating and harmonizing. You are a people person, and you're always intrigued by how people interact with one another. Cooperation comes very easily to you - in fact, it's usually your first instinct.<\/p>\n<p>Libra is an Air sign, and yes, sometimes people with your Ascendant can come across as airheads! However, that can simply be a first impression. You prefer to avoid direct confrontation. However, you can be quick to point out injustices. You prefer people are treated fairly and as equals.<\/p>\n<p>You usually prefer that others don't experience your ups and downs or your difficult side. However, this sometimes works against you. In an effort to keep things pleasant, you may give off the impression that you're fine when you're not. As a child, you may have been \"typecast\" as the easygoing, agreeable one, and it can sometimes feel difficult to break out of that mold.<\/p>\n<p>An imbalanced, chaotic environment can be particularly challenging for you to navigate, and it can lead to quite a bit of anxiety. You will do whatever you can to balance things out. You pay more attention than most to the sounds, colors, and others' moods around you, and you can spend quite a bit of time and energy on attempts to bring things into harmony. For your own health and well-being, you can benefit from taking extra time to yourself learning what it is that you need and want, as you may too often confuse others' needs and wants with your own. If you end up going along with others so that you can keep the peace, you may be doing yourself a disservice at times.<\/p>\n<p>You truly understand others and this makes it very comfortable to be around you, particularly if in one-to-one setups. You make a good counselor. Design, marketing, the law, and art are well-starred. You love orderliness and beautiful things and surroundings.<\/p>\n<p>The condition of Venus, Libra's ruling planet, by sign, house, and aspect will give you further details (and refinements) about your personal image.

It represents our will to live and our creative life force. Just as the planets revolve around the Sun in our solar system, we derive our life purpose from the Sun in our natal charts. The Sun is our \u201cadult\u201d\u2013 the part of us that censors our \u201cinner child,\u201d reasons things out, and makes final decisions. The Sun also gives clues to our overall vitality. The Sun directs us and can be considered \u201cthe boss\u201d of our chart.<\/span><br \/>\nWhen people ask you \"What's your sign?\", Scorpio would be your answer. Technically, though, it's your Sun sign that is Scorpio, and you're made up of many different sign combinations. Even so, your Sun sign is highly influential and significant.<\/p>\n<p>Scorpios are known for their intensity. They are determined folk who positively throw themselves into whatever they do \u2014 but getting them to commit to something is rarely an easy task. In fact, it\u2019s better not to even try to \"get them\" to do anything. Solar Scorpios undoubtedly have their own mind. And, their primary motivation is unlikely to be prestige (like their Capricorn friends), or even authority (Leos can have that, too)\u2013it's&nbsp;<i>real&nbsp;<\/i>power.&nbsp;Their power can absolutely be of the \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d variety, just as long as they have it!<\/p>\n<p>As a Sun sign Scorpio, you are intense and have a powerful memory. You feel things deeply, and you retain your emotional memories longer than many. Scorpio is a Water sign, and you are unusually empathetic and perceptive, picking up on the tiniest of cues on emotional levels. You're able to read a person quickly and thoroughly. Scorpio is also from the Fixed family, and this endows you with endurance, tenacity, and loyalty.<\/p>\n<p>To others, Scorpios seem to have plenty of willpower. They probably do. Scorpios do know what they want, and they won't go out and grab it at the wrong moment. They simply sit back, watch (quite expertly), and then get it only when the moment is just right. This apparent patience is, in fact, their powerful strategic skills at work.<\/p>\n<p>Scorpio isn't afraid of getting their hands (their bodies, their minds) dirty. The darker side of life intrigues them, and they're always ready to investigate. With Scorpio as your Sun sign, you are \"all in\" when you choose to do something. You're there for people you love, and you are unafraid of the darker, deeper side of things.<\/p>\n<p>Scorpios rarely give up. They have tremendous staying power. As a Scorpio, you are not in the slightest intimidated by anybody or anything -- at least that's how you come across.<\/p>\n<p>Confrontations are not a problem. In fact, talk to any Scorpio about their lives, and you'll probably be in awe about all they've experienced. Upheaval, change, and intensity of experience may seem to follow them wherever they go. When a Scorpio is optimistic or learns optimism, instead of expecting the worst, they'll find that they possess amazing regenerative powers \u2014 the power to heal, create, and transform.<\/p>\n<p>As a Scorpio, you are not a person who takes things (or people, relationships) lightly, and for you to be on board, you need to find personal meaning in whatever you do. You may discover that there are people who are intimidated by you since you tend to exude a particular intensity that may have some wondering and worrying how you feel about them. Once they get to know you, however, they realize that although you have strong feelings and opinions, you are exceedingly understanding. <\/p>\n<p>Scorpio is known as a vengeful sign, probably due to that long memory and passionate nature mentioned above, but on the other side of the coin, they love deeply and don't give up on those they love without very good reason. Of course, learning to let go doesn't come easily to this sign, but it's far from impossible. In fact, the sign of Scorpio rules rebirth and transformation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You are amazingly resilient, undeniably perceptive, and highly intelligent. You can be very shrewd when you need to be, and you love to draw up plans and strategies. You are extremely creative and enterprising, as well as daring and brave. Rarely pretentious, Scorpio is a sign that places tremendous value on authenticity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Your Sun sign is modified by various factors, including the aspects it makes to other planets and points, its house position, the house with the sign the Sun rules (Leo) on its cusp, and your Pluto and Mars signs since they are Scorpio's planetary rulers. These positions add more layers to the Sun in Scorpio interpretation. Scorpio is a Fixed Water sign.

You make an impression on others -- you have \"presence\" -- and you know it. You are self-conscious, although you may prefer to project a strong image. Whether you're quiet or loud, you make a mark in the world, but avoid obsessing over what others think of you. Accept that you need to be a leader or an innovator, and go for it, but be careful not to be overbearing with others. Your personality shines, and you're always noticed. You're a natural leader in your personal life, and you're extremely enterprising.<\/p>\n<p class=\"zp-subheading\">Moon in Third House<\/p><p><i>The Moon in the houses can reveal where and how we go about seeking emotional satisfaction. If it's an issue, we can discover vital clues to the reason for perpetual emotional unrest through the study of the house position of the Moon, and these can manifest as constant changes or ups and downs in the areas of life ruled by the house. It is in these areas that we should aim to make deep attachments rather than chase superficial and temporary emotional thrills if we are seeking out a genuine feeling of belonging and emotional fulfillment.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>With the Moon in the third house of your natal chart, you are very responsive, communicative, and curious. You may very well have a talent for imitating others or for picking up languages. You might either intellectualize your emotions rather than genuinely feel them and deal with them, or you communicate with excessive emotion. Some of you may do both at different times, and as you mature and develop, you learn to find a balance. <\/p>\n<p>Your opinions and ideas change often, and it may be that you sometimes adopt others' points of view and express their ideas as if they were your own. This is not necessarily because you are a copy-cat, but because you are such a quick study and you are so very sensitive to others' opinions. You share ideas for enjoyment. You can be nervous and restless, requiring frequent changes of scenery, even if this movement or travel typically takes place locally.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that your feelings and early-life experiences have a strong influence on your ideas and perspectives. This can mean that, when you're in a rush, you are following hunches more often than facts, and being aware of this tendency can help you check yourself. This way, you can avoid making too many subjective decisions or choices when objectivity would benefit you more.<\/p>\n<p>You can have fond memories of your early life and many people with this position maintain strong ties to their childhood friends or neighborhood throughout life.<\/p>\n<p>Curiously, even though you love ideas and learning, studying is not necessarily your forte. In fact, you prefer to pick up information more organically.  People with the Moon in the third house are usually very effective at communicating, whether through the written or spoken word, and often both. You are also curious to a fault. You love to know what's going on around you! Sometimes, this trait borders into busybody territory.<\/p>\n<p class=\"zp-subheading\">Mercury in First House<\/p><p class=\"zp-subheading\">Venus in Second House<\/p><p>Tangible expressions of love and affection are essential to you. Your tastes are usually \"simply extravagant,\" well-defined, strong, and something you are proud of. Some might feel you have a talent for finding items of value and good taste. You are certainly attracted to items of quality. You may use generosity for your own benefit\u2013in other words, you might give gifts with the expectation of reward. Some people with this position are hedonistic and overly attached to winning admiration from a partner, at the expense of discovering true love. Many with Venus in the second house have pronounced musical ability. Your neck and upper chest can be erogenous zones, and your voice is unusually attractive. You usually don't jump into a new relationship quickly unless Venus aspects Mars or Uranus, but if you do, your feelings grow gradually. A partner who makes you feel safe and secure is ideal for you. Once committed, your love is usually long-lasting and sincere. You have high values and others will find it hard to sway you in this area. Sensual, the world of touch and smell is most appealing to you. Complex or mysterious partners are not as intriguing to you as simple and genuine ones.<\/p>\n<p class=\"zp-subheading\">Mars in Third House<\/p><p class=\"zp-subheading\">Jupiter in Third House<\/p><p>With Jupiter in the third house of your chart, you are forward-looking--a real planner. You are endlessly curious and enjoy making happy connections with others. Sharing ideas with others is important to you. In fact, you take great pleasure in doing so, and this may be why many people with this position are good teachers and enjoy guiding others. You are able to see the big picture and thus often are turned to for advice. You are sincerely interested in others, and you quickly put people at ease in social situations.<\/p>\n<p class=\"zp-subheading\">Saturn in First House<\/p><p class=\"zp-subheading\">Uranus in Second House<\/p><p class=\"zp-subheading\">Neptune in Third House<\/p><p>Dry, cold facts are hard for you to absorb, and as a result, traditional academics might not appeal. However, you are talented at visualization and whole-style learning. You are perceptive and dreamy, although you often have your head in the clouds and might miss important details. Sticking to schedules can be difficult, and so can tending to errands, communications, and other necessary daily activities. You might \"tune out\" when you hear specific directions, and consequently miss helpful details. You might, as a result, frequently be late for appointments or miss them altogether. In your communications, you can quickly put others at ease, as you seem to understand them intuitively. You express yourself creatively, imaginatively, and with great charm. However, you might also unwittingly encourage misunderstandings, as you rarely are definite in what you say. Learning, especially when young, can be challenged only because you lack discipline or the style of learning is not creative enough to hold your interest.<\/p>\n<p class=\"zp-subheading\">Pluto in First House<\/p><p>You radiate intensity, and others' first impressions of you tend to be strong, one way or the other. You might often intimidate others with your manner. You can be very protective of your privacy, yet you generate much intrigue and interest with your strong presence. You might struggle with fears of being overpowered, rejected, or minimized, yet few can guess that you could be anything less than confident! Your first instinct in new situations is gutsy and determined, defensive and intense. You rarely accept the obvious or the surface of matters -- instead, you look through situations in order to read any information on hidden levels. Strive to avoid getting your back up or viewing life as a battleground.<\/p>\n<p class=\"zp-subheading\">Chiron in Eighth House<\/p><p class=\"zp-subheading\">Lilith in Sixth House<\/p><p class=\"zp-subheading\">North Node in Eighth House<\/p><p class=\"zp-subheading\">Part of Fortune in Tenth House<\/p><p class=\"zp-subheading\">Vertex in Eighth House<\/p><h3 class=\"zp-report-section-title zp-aspects-title\">Aspects<\/h3><p class=\"zp-subheading\">Sun Sextile Moon <span class=\"zp-orb\">(orb 5&#176;22')<\/span><\/p><p>With the Sun and Moon in harmony with one another in your natal chart, generally speaking, your emotions and will are at peace with one another, suggesting a reasonably balanced personality. The \"messages\" you received in childhood were explicit, or at least not contradictory overall, and you have a stronger sense of purpose and appreciation of harmony than most people. You can be personally popular, likely because you <i>expect<\/i> harmony in your relationships. You are unusually open to relationships, and you're attractive to others. A certain level of self-confidence and a sense of security make you quite easy to deal with on many levels. Your relaxed, easygoing disposition puts others at ease.<\/p>\n<p>Because your expectation of harmony is well-developed, you may not be prepared for conflict, and you might often avoid rocking the boat. In fact, you may often acquiesce, if only to maintain a feeling of balance and harmony. After all, conflict is something you not only dislike, it\u2019s something you may fear. In some ways, you may be too accepting\u2013of yourself and others. You may benefit from questioning life more often, or you run the risk of taking things for granted. Even so, you are prepared to put effort into making things work.<\/p>\n<p>Your vitality is usually good and quite constant. Unless other parts of your chart strongly suggest otherwise, you are not a very hard-driving person, but your constitution is strong. You seem less prone to the kinds of ups and downs that plague those with challenging aspects between the Sun and Moon. This is because your goals and emotional needs are in harmony, despite being different. You have a fantastic ability to understand your limits, and this positively impacts your life in many areas. You are also a brilliant problem-solver.<\/p>\n<p class=\"zp-subheading\">Sun Sextile Jupiter <span class=\"zp-orb\">(orb 2&#176;57')<\/span><\/p><p class=\"zp-subheading\">Sun Conjunction Pluto <span
